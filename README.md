# CuteBot
CuteBot is a bot which improves our discord server. To interact easily with the discord API I have used ["discord.py"](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

CuteBot can be used to play games or just to have some fun. Every game needs a seperate Text Channel. Furthermore a Text Channel only for the CuteBot is needed.
